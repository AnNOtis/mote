{"name":"mote","body":"Minimalist template engine\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nMote is a very simple template engine optimized for performance.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUsage is very similar to that of ERB:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ntemplate = Mote.parse(\"This is a template\")\r\ntemplate.call #=> \"This is a template\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSilly example, you may say, and I would agree. What follows is a short list of\r\nthe different use cases you may face:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% if user == \"Bruno\"\r\n  {{user}} rhymes with Piano\r\n% elsif user == \"Brutus\"\r\n  {{user}} rhymes with Opus\r\n% end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Control flow\r\n\r\nLines that start with `%` are evaluated as Ruby code.\r\n\r\n## Assignment\r\n\r\nWhatever it is between `{{` and `}}` gets printed in the template.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\nThere's nothing special about comments, it's just a `#` inside your Ruby code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% # This is a comment.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Block evaluation\r\n\r\nAs with control instructions, it happens naturally:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% 3.times do |i|\r\n  {{i}}\r\n% end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\nThe values passed to the template are available as local variables:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nexample = Mote.parse(\"Hello {{name}}\")\r\nassert_equal \"Hello world\", example.call(name: \"world\")\r\nassert_equal \"Hello Bruno\", example.call(name: \"Bruno\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Helpers\r\n\r\nThere's a helper available in the `Mote::Helpers` module, and you are\r\nfree to include it in your code. To do it, just type:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ninclude Mote::Helpers\r\n```\r\n\r\n## mote\r\n\r\nThe `mote` helper receives a file name and a hash and returns the rendered\r\nversion of its content. The compiled template is cached for subsequent calls.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nassert_equal \"***\\n\", mote(\"test/basic.mote\", n: 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAs usual, you can install it using rubygems.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install mote\r\n```\r\n","tagline":"Minimum Operational Template","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
