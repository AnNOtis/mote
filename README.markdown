Mote
====

Minimum Operational Template.

Description
-----------

Mote is the little brother of ERB. It only provides a subset of ERB's
features, but praises itself of being simple--both internally and externally--
and super fast. It was born out of experimentations while discussing
[NOLATE](https://github.com/antirez/nolate), another small library with the
same goals and more features.

Usage
-----

Usage is very similar to that of ERB:

    template = Mote.parse("This is a template")
    template.call #=> "This is a template"

Silly example, you may say, and I would agree. What follows is a short list of
the different use cases you may face:

## Assignment

    example = Mote.parse("<%= \"***\" %>")
    assert_equal "***", example.call

## Comment

    example = Mote.parse("*<%# \"*\" %>*")
    assert_equal "**", example.call

## Control flow

    example = Mote.parse("<% if false %>*<% else %>***<% end %>")
    assert_equal "***", example.call

## Block evaluation

    example = Mote.parse("<% 3.times { %>*<% } %>")
    assert_equal "***", example.call

## Parameters

    example = Mote.parse("<% params[:n].times { %>*<% } %>")
    assert_equal "***", example[n: 3]
    assert_equal "****", example[n: 4]

Two things are worth noting in the last example: the first is that as the
returned value is a `Proc`, you can call it with square brackets and anything
you put inside becomes a parameter. Second, that within the template you have
access to those parameters through the `params` hash, instead of the usual
approach of converting each key to a local variable.

# Helpers

There are a couple helpers available in the `Mote::Helpers` module, and you are
free to include it in your code. To do it, just type:

    include Mote::Helpers

Here are the available helpers:

## mote

The `mote` helper receives a template string and returns the rendered version
of it:

    assert_equal "1 2 3", mote("1 <%= 2 %> 3")

It works with parameters too:

    assert_equal "1 2 3", mote("1 <%= params[:n] %> 3", :n => 2)

## mote_file

The `mote_file` helper receives a file name and returns the rendered version of
its content. The compiled template is cached for subsequent calls.

    assert_equal "***\n", mote_file("test/basic.erb", :n => 3)

Installation
------------

    $ gem install mote --pre
